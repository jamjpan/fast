    randvehs!(vehfile, R; ts, n=100)

Writes a random sample of `n` vehicles to file `vehfile`.

Random nodes are selected from request origins to serve as starting
locations. Vehicle start times, which are always 0, are interpreted as
seconds relative to `ts`, which should be a time string in the form
HH:MM:SS.
